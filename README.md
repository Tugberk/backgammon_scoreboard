# backgammon_scoreboard
a scoreboard built with flask for backgammon games

- built with flask
- uses vanilla javascript and bootstrap

1. you can change the number which the game ends. a button toggles that part, default at 5. that can be changed, or radio buttons can be added to make it fit your needs.
2. the first player is always me. this is not for a tournament, it is for personal use. therefore the results will show either WON or LOST.
3. javascript submits the form automatically when anyone is at the winner score. however, this can also be manually done. the one with higher score will be regarded as winner.
4. there are no controls of inputs. this can easily be done by stripping or checking in python code.
5. delete is added in order to correct if there was a mistake.
6. no sessions, for personal use.
